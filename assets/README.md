## Context:
Final solo project, created from scatch within a week. A planning document of an outline of my anticipated progress throughout the project is attached.

## Learning Goals:
1. Solidify & illustrated understanding of DRY JS, event delegation to handle similar event listeners. 
2. Understand the difference between data model and how data is displyed on the DOM. 
3. Displayed problem solving process to break down large and complex problems. Solved everything step by step. 
4. Refactored code. 

## Wins:
1. Understood event delegation to a decent extent.
2. Was able to get the app to work and function well. 
3. Finished the project with enough time to refactor code. 
4. Refactored CSS code towards the end and deleted unnecessary code. 
5. Designed the app using my favorite colors. 
6. I started early and spent a good amount of time each day ~ 8 hours/day so that I can finish in time! I spent around 40+ hours on this project. 
7. Figured out how to make a gif and attach it to this readMe, thanks to @Johann

## Challenges:
- Getting started with JS.
- Had lots of repeated code in JS, was difficult refactoring the code. 
- Planning out my logic was difficult, had to use lots of scrap paper and be meticulous about the planning process. 
- CSS was tough, was stuck on a part for hours but figured out it was a JS code issue.
- Problem solving and figuring out what goes before/next and how to execute was difficult.
- Naming conventions was difficult, what made sense to me at one point didn't make sense to me later down the line and I had to make changes. 
- Commiting was not working well at first but I started to commit more and towards the end, I made a new branch for every new little task I completed, in case something broke.
